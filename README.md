# Black Jack

I thought to buid the app with Ionic to exploit the features of ReactJS and features Ionic has with it's beautiful build in UI components.

This is a progressive app build with Ionic that can be easily compiled into mobile app, Android or iOS, build for native desktop app with Electron or served in a browser.
